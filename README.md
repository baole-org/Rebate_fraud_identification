# Rebate_fraud_checking
Company X is promoting a campaign where users who makes payment by scanning QR code at merchants' store will be rewarded with Rebate.

Rebate is determined at 30% of transaction value, capped at $2 per txn.

It is reported that some users are colluding with merchants to abuse this promotion campaign. Our job is to identify the potential abusers, both users and merchants.
